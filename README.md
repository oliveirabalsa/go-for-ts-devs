> A repository to help TypeScript developers learn Go, comparing code examples in Go and TypeScript.

## Introduction

Welcome to the **GoLang for TypeScript Developers** repository! This repository aims to assist TypeScript developers in learning the Go programming language by providing side-by-side code examples in Go and TypeScript.

Whether you're an experienced TypeScript developer or just starting out, this repository will help you understand the syntax, concepts, and idiomatic patterns of Go, drawing parallels with TypeScript.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `arrays_slices.go` and `arrays.ts`: Comparison of array usage in Go and TypeScript.
- `class.go` and `class.ts`: Comparison of class definitions and methods in Go and TypeScript.
- `function.go` and `function.ts`: Comparison of functions in Go and TypeScript.
- `and much more...`
- `README.md`: You are here! This document provides an overview of the repository.

## Getting Started

To begin with the code examples, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oliveirabalsa/go-for-ts-devs.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

   ```bash
   cd go-for-ts-devs
   ```

3. Explore the code examples in each file, such as `arrays_slices.go` and `arrays.ts`, and compare the Go and TypeScript code side by side.

4. Run the code examples to see the output and understand the differences between Go and TypeScript. Simply enter the desired folder and execute:

   **Golang**
   ```bash
   go run *.go
   ```

   **TypeScript**
   ```bash
   npx ts-node arrays.ts
   ```

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you find errors, wish to add new code examples, or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's make this repository a valuable resource for the TypeScript community learning Go!
